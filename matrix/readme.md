A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.


**Order of a Matrix** : The order of a matrix is defined in terms of its number of rows and columns.
 

Order of a matrix = No. of rows × No. of columnsTherefore, Matrix [M] is a matrix of order 3 × 3.

#### Properties of Matrix addition and multiplication:

A+B = B+A (Commutative)
(A+B)+C = A+ (B+C) (Associative)
AB ≠ BA (Not Commutative)
(AB) C = A (BC) (Associative)
A (B+C) = AB+AC (Distributive)
