A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.


**Order of a Matrix** : The order of a matrix is defined in terms of its number of rows and columns.
 

Order of a matrix = No. of rows × No. of columnsTherefore, Matrix [M] is a matrix of order 3 × 3.

#### Properties of Matrix addition and multiplication:

A+B = B+A (Commutative)
(A+B)+C = A+ (B+C) (Associative)
AB ≠ BA (Not Commutative)
(AB) C = A (BC) (Associative)
A (B+C) = AB+AC (Distributive)

### Terminologies
* Square Matrix: A square Matrix has as many rows as it has columns. i.e. no of rows = no of columns.
* Symmetric matrix: A square matrix is said to be symmetric if the transpose of original matrix is equal to its original matrix. i.e. (AT) = A.
* Skew-symmetric: A skew-symmetric (or antisymmetric or antimetric[1]) matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals its negative.i.e. (AT) = -A.
* Diagonal Matrix:A diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero. The term usually refers to square matrices.
* Identity Matrix:A square matrix in which all the elements of the principal diagonal are ones and all other elements are zeros.Identity matrix is denoted as I.
* Orthogonal Matrix: A matrix is said to be orthogonal if AAT = ATA = I.
* Idemponent Matrix: A matrix is said to be idemponent if A2 = A.
* Involutary Matrix: A matrix is said to be Involutary if A2 = I.
* Singular Matrix: A square matrix is said to be singular matrix if its determinant is zero i.e. |A|=0
* Nonsingular Matrix: A square matrix is said to be non-singular matrix if its determinant is non-zero.


#### Matrices Addition
The addition of two matrices A m*n and Bm*n gives a matrix Cm*n. Here, m and n represents the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively.

#### Matrices Subtraction
The subtraction of two matrices Am*n and Bm*n gives a matrix Cm*n. Here, m and n represents the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively.
