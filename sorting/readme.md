Sorting any sequence means to arrange the elements of that sequence according to some specific criterion.

In-Place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. 

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is an In-Place sorting algorithm. This algorithm works in a similar way of sorting a deck of playing cards. 

The idea is to start iterating from the second element of array till last element and for every element insert at its correct position in the subarray before it. 

## Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

The subarray which is already sorted. 
Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

#### Characteristics of Insertion Sort:
* This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
* Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
* Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

## What is a stable sorting algorithm? 
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input data set
