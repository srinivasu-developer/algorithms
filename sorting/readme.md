Sorting any sequence means to arrange the elements of that sequence according to some specific criterion.

In-Place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. 

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is an In-Place sorting algorithm. This algorithm works in a similar way of sorting a deck of playing cards. 

The idea is to start iterating from the second element of array till last element and for every element insert at its correct position in the subarray before it. 



## What is a stable sorting algorithm? 
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input data set
